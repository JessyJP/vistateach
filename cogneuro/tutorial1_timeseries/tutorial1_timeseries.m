%% Load and visualize the data
% In an fMRI experiment sequential brain volumes are collected while the
% stimuli and task are manipulatd. Each sample point in the brain volume is
% called a voxel (volume element). 

% The data are saved in the same folder as the tutorial
load data

% Open a figure window
figure; colormap('gray')

% Here is a movie of a single slice of the brain over the course of an fMRI
% experiment where the subject was presented either words or scrambled
% words. Brain volumes were collected every 2 seconds (TR = 2seconds).

% Make a movie of slice number 15
for ii = 1:size(data,4)
    % Show the image of this slice during volume number ii
    imagesc(squeeze(data(:,:,15,ii))); 
    title(sprintf('Volume %d, time=%d seconds',ii,ii*2));
    % pause for .2 seconds. This means that the video is 10x as fast as the
    % real data acquisition
    drawnow; pause(.2);
end

% QUESTION: What are the circles at the left side of the image that show
% large changes in signal intensity? Hint: They are outside of the brain

%% View the time series from a single voxel

% It may not look like there is substantial change in pixel intensity over
% time. But, if we extract the time series from a voxel in the visual
% cortex we find there is fluctuation in the signal over time. This is due
% to the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) contrast in these images

% Extract the time series from a voxel row 53, column 65, slice 10. 
% (The function squeeze converts the 4D data, (x,y,z,time) into a vector)
ts1 = squeeze(data(53,65,10,:));

% This is the number of brain volumes at the repetition rate (TR)
nTR = size(data,4);   

% Plot the time series for this single voxel.

% Questions:
%
% 1. What are the units of the two axes? 
%
% 2. Find one voxel where the signal varies more over time and another
% voxel where the signal varies less over time than voxel 53 65 10. Plot
% each voxel's time series and title the figure apropriately. Save these as
% pdfs and turn them in.
% Hint: the function std will compute the standard deviation of a vector.
%
% 3. Do you think that we are more or less likely to find an effect of the
% stimulus in the voxel with higher standard deviation? Explain your
% thinking.  
% Hint:  There isn't a trivial right answer.  There are competing forces.

%% Associate the time series with the stimuli
%
% These are the times when each event started. Each event lasts 12 seconds
% and there is a blank screen in between events. The timing is with respect
% to the fMRI volume number. For example 4 means that the event started at
% during the acquisition of volume number 4 (which is 8 seconds into the
% experiment because volumes are collected every 2 seconds. We mark each
% volume during which the event occured meaning that there are a block of
% six volumes devoted to each occurance of the stimulus

events_words    = [12:17, 21:26, 41:46, 61:66, 86:91, 95:100];
events_scramble = [4:9, 32:37, 52:57, 69:74, 77:82, 104:109];

% A NOTE FOR "REAL" DATA ANALYSIS
% In most analysis packages there are different ways to code the timing of
% events. This is usually called an event file or stimulus file. They are
% always essentially the same thing: a text file or spreadsheet denoting
% what happened when and for how long.

% Now that we have our event times expressed in terms of scan number we can
% make an ideal time series that would reflect the expected response
% profiles for a voxel that responds to words or scrambled words. We will
% express this as a matrix with 2 columns, column 1 containing the
% predicted time series for words and column 2 containing the predicted
% time series for scrambled words. There will be 114 rows in the matrix
% because there were 114 volumes collected in the fMRI experiment. This is
% called the DESIGN MATRIX because it denotes the experimental design.

% First we allocate a 114x2 matrix full of zeros
X = zeros(114,2); 
% In the first column denote when words were presented by putting a 1 in
% each location where the word stimulus was on
X(events_words,1) = 1;
% In the second column denote when scrambled words were presented
X(events_scramble,2) = 1;

% The image shows two columns of the design matrix

figure; 
% These are the times when a word (red) or a scrambled word (blue) are
% presented. The subplot command allows you to put multiple plots in a
% figure window
subplot(2,1,1)
plot(X(:,1),'-r'); hold on
plot(X(:,2),'-b')
legend('words', 'scramble')
xlabel('Volume Number'); ylabel('Signal')

% The times for the words and scrambled words are marked in the two columns
% of this image.  The two columns form a matrix, X, called the design
% matrix. One column shows the moment when a volume of the brain is
% collected and a word is presented.  The other shows the volumes when a
% scrambled word was presented.

subplot(2,1,2)
% The apostrophe (') symbol transposes the matrix X (i.e., turns the
% columns into rows). We are only doing this so that the 2 plots have a
% common x axis. After transposing the design matrix the x axis is time
% and the y axis is condition rather than vice versa.
imagesc(X'); 
colormap('gray'); xlabel('Volume Number'); 
set(gca, 'ytick',[1 2],'yticklabel', {'words' 'scramble'});

% THE DESIGN MATRIX IS CRITICAL TO UNDERSTAND FOR FMRI ANALYSIS

%% Analyze the time series

% When a neural event occurs it does not cause a rapid peak in the BOLD
% signal, but instead there is a slow response that evolves over time.
%
% We know roughly how the vascular response measured by BOLD evolves over
% time. This means that when there is an event that stimulates a brief
% neural response (say a flash of light), the resulting BOLD signal will
% change in a characteristic way. We call this the hemodynamic response
% function (HRF).

% Load up a typical hemodynamic response function and plot it
load hrf.mat
figure; 
plot(hrf); xlabel('Volume (TR = 2 seconds)');
ylabel('Canonical BOLD response to a neural impulse')

% Question:
%
% 4. What does this HRF suggest about the type of cognitive questions that
% can be adressed with fMRI? For example would it be feasible to measure
% precise timing differences in the neural response to different types of
% stimuli? Based on this HRF give a few examples of questions that are and
% are not appropriate to adress with fMRI.

%% Convert the raw scanner numbers to percent signal change

% The digital values coming from the scanner have no physical significance.
% digital values from some regions are a little higher than others for
% instrumental reasons, say because the measurement coil is more sensitive
% to the surface of the brain than the middle.  Other uninteresting reasons
% also give rise to these differences.
%
% It is common, therefore, to express the time series as a percent
% modulation around the mean signal. This moves us towards comparing more
% similar variations - though even this move is not really enough.

meanTS = mean(ts1(:));
ts1 = 100* ((ts1 - meanTS)/ meanTS);

% Plot the modulation
figure; 
plot(1:nTR,ts1)
xlabel('TR')
ylabel('Percent modulation of BOLD signal')
grid on

% Question: 
%
% 5. Suppose the MRI scanner is more sensitive to voxels on the surface of
% the brain compared to voxels in the middle of the brain.  The brain
% responses in the two voxels are the same, but because of the scanner
% sensitivity difference the fMRI responses are ts1 and 2*ts1. What will
% happen to the responses when we transform them from scanner values to
% percent modulation?

%% Convolving the design matrix with the HRF (sorry for the jargon)
%
% We can incorporate the knowlege of this hemodynamic response function
% into our design matrix by "convolving" each event with the hrf. This
% means that rather than being represented by a brief spike, the regressors
% are now smoothed in time to match the typical hemodynamic response. It is
% not important that you understand this specific code, just the idea that
% each event is multiplied or convolved with the known hemodynamic response
% function (HRF). Convolution is basically a fancy term for pointwise
% multiplication

tmp = conv(X(:,1),hrf); X(:,1) = tmp(1:length(X(:,1)));
tmp = conv(X(:,2),hrf); X(:,2) = tmp(1:length(X(:,2)));

% Now notice that the events in the design matrix are smoothed in time
% reflecting the predicted hrf.
figure; 

% Plot the new predicted time series after convolution
subplot(2,1,1)
plot(X(:,1),'-r'); hold on
plot(X(:,2),'-b')
legend('words', 'scramble')
% Show an image of the new design matrix
subplot(2,1,2)
imagesc(X'); colormap('gray'); xlabel('Volume Number'); 
set(gca, 'ytick',[1 2],'yticklabel', {'word' 'scramble'});


%% Fitting the linear model to the time series

% In fMRI a linear model is used to estimate how much each event type
% effects the measured BOLD signal. This is just a standard linear 
% regression model that you already know from your stats classes. The main 
% tricks are how we set up our matrix of predictor variables. 
% Another way to explain this is that we want to find the best way to scale  
% our predictor matrix X to match our measured signal. The scaling factor or 
% weights for each condition are  related to the amount of BOLD signal 
% modulation produced by that event. Let's look at our predictors compare 
% to our measured signal in this voxel.

figure; 
subplot(2,1,1)
plot(1:nTR,ts1)
subplot(2,1,2)
plot(X(:,1),'-r'); hold on
plot(X(:,2),'-b')
legend('words', 'scramble')

% There is one more step before we fit a linear model to predict our
% measured BOLD signal based on the regressors we created around our
% experimental design. As we said above the units of the measured signal
% are arbitrary. We are interested in predicting changes in the signal over
% time but we do not care about the mean value of the time series or other
% aribtrary factors related to the scanner. To deal with this we include
% regressors in the design matrix to measure and eliminate nuisance factors
% such as the arbitraryness of the units and slow drift in signal intensity
% due to imperfections in the instrament. These are often referred to as
% nuisance regressors. Most researchers will include a column of ones to
% deal with the offset and a linear term to deal with scanner drift.
X = horzcat(X, ones(size(X,1),1), linspace(-1,1,size(X,1))');
% Here is our new design matrix
figure; imagesc(X); colormap('gray')
% Lable the columns
set(gca,'xtick',1:4,'xticklabel',{'words' 'scramble' 'offset' 'linear trend'});

% We fit a linear model in which we scale each column of the design matrix
% to best fit our measured signal. Usually a linear model means you have a
% vector you wish to predict, in this case the time series, as the weighted
% sum of other vectors in the columns of a matrix, in this case the design
% matrix.  The weights are often called 'beta' weights when we analyze fMRI
% data. Here is the equation for the linear model
%
%    ts1 = X * betaWeights
%
% Matlab solves these problems with the very simple formula
B = X\ts1;

% THIS IS THE SAME AS
%   B = regress(ts1, X);
% if you have the statistics toolbox
%
% The point to take away is that fitting a linear model to fMRI data is no
% different than any regression probelm. We set up a matrix of predictor
% variables and use any regression function to find weights that predict
% our measurement as a weighted sum of our regressors.

% These are the 'beta' weights for the (1) word and (2) scrambled word
% events, along with the weights on our nuisance variables.
disp(B)

%% Comparing the solution with the true data

% The values in B are our beta weights. As with any regression analysis
% these are the weights that scale our regressors to best predict the
% signal. We can now plot our predicted signal agains our measured signal
ts1_predicted = X*B;

figure; hold
plot(ts1_predicted,'-r')
plot(ts1,'-b')

% What about a scatter plot? What would that tell us?

%% Calculate the beta values for the whole slice
% Now we can loop over all the voxels in this slice (z=10) and fit this
% model to each voxel. Even if this code doesn't make sense try to
% apreciate the fact that we are fitting this same regression equation to
% every voxel in this image. What we obtain is a set of 'beta' weights for
% each voxel in the image. The resulting beta weight images show locations
% where a given condition effects the BOLD signal

% Allocate space
B_words    = zeros(size(data,1),size(data,2));
B_scramble = zeros(size(data,1),size(data,2));

% First loop over the first dimension of this slice (the rows)
for ii = 1:size(data,1)
    % For each row we will now loop over the columns in that row
    for jj = 1:size(data,2)
        % Pull out the time series for the voxel in row number ii of column
        % number jj in slice number 10
        ts = squeeze(data(ii,jj,10,:));
        % Then fit our linear model 
        B = X\ts;
        % Now lets take the beta weight for words and put it into a matrix
        % and the weight for scrambled words and put it into another matrix
        B_words(ii,jj) = B(1);
        B_scramble(ii,jj) = B(2);
    end
end

%% We can now visualize the beta weights as an image
% This image shows how much each condition effected the BOLD signal in each
% voxel of the image. Hence this map retains the same orientation as our
% original data
figure;
imagesc(B_words);
% Label the demensions of the axes
xlabel ('Anterior <--> Posterior'); ylabel('Left <--> Right');
% Add a colorbar
colorbar
% Scale the axis of the color bar to be from 0 to 30. This is roughly the
% range of our beta weights
caxis([0 30]);
% Visualize the weights for the scrambled condition
figure;
imagesc(B_scramble); colorbar; caxis([0 30]);
xlabel ('Anterior <--> Posterior'); ylabel('Left <--> Right');

% Questions
%
% 6. What do the colors in the map represent? 
%
% 7. What can we learn from looking at these color maps? Does the pattern
% of responses make sense (on the scale of brain lobe)? Why or why not?
%
% 8. One of the typical ways neuroscientists localize a brain region that
% responds more to one stimulus class compare to another is by making a
% subtraction image that compares the weights obtained for each condition.
% Make a subtraction image. Do you see a region in which the responses are
% larger to words than scrambled words? Or vice versa?
%
% Extra Credit: How might we normalize these difference maps to make the
% effects more aparent?


%% Overlay the heatmap on a high resolution anatomical image
% Typically it is nicer to look at an activation map overlaid over a high
% resolution anatomical image. Lets load up a high resolution anatomical
% that is in register with this fmri data. This is saved in an image format
% know as nifti
load Inplane.mat

% This is what slice 10 of this image looks like. 
figure;imagesc(inplane(:,:,10)); colormap('gray');

% To overlay our activation map we must first interpolate it to be the same
% resolution as our anatomy image which is 256x256 pixels
map = imresize(B_words, [256 256]);

% Now overlay the colormap on the background image masking out all beta
% values below 10
threshold = 10;
overlay2dHeatmap(inplane(:,:,10),map, threshold)

% Question:
%
% 9. Make an image showing a slice where there is a particularly large
% difference between the response to words and scrambled words.
%
% 10. Suppose you identified a region that consitently showed a larger
% response to words than scrambled words in a group of subjects. How might
% you design an experiment to test this region's relevance for behavior
% using either fMRI or any other method that you have learned about in this
% coures or elsewhere?

%% Final Question 1: Compute statistics
%
% Before we put this figure in a manuscript we would have to calculate the
% standard error of each beta value so that we could associate it with a
% p-value. One of the complexities of doing statistics on fMRI data are
% autocorrelations: each timepoint is correlated with the previous
% timepoint for a variety of reasons. This means that the residuals of our
% linear model have structure that makes it more difficult to compute
% statistics. For those of you with a background in time series analysis
% you will start thinking about a variety of methods like autoregressive
% models and pre-whitening that are applicable here. In most analysis
% packages there are standard ways to deal with these issues but this is
% beyond the scope of this tutorial (or this course). For the time being,
% let's forget about autocorrelation.
%
% Identify a group of voxels that looks interesting. For example, based on
% one of the contrasts above. Average the timeseries for all the voxels.
% This is often referred to as a region of interest (ROI).
% Then use your favorite regression function to fit a linear model and
% compute p-values for the different conditions (it's fine to ignore issues
% noted above).

%% Final Question 2: Compute correlation map
%
% Another interesting way to analyze fMRI data is to examine correlations
% between the time-courses in different regions/voxels. This is often
% refered to as "functional connectivity". Compute the correlation between
% the timecourse from your ROI (above) and the timecourse in every other
% voxel in the brain. Now visualize this correlation map. Is it
% interesting/surprising that the fMRI signal in this region is correlated
% with so many other regions?
